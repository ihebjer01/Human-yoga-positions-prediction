# Human-yoga-positions-prediction
the challenge was building deep learning model that could accurately classify Yoga  images displaying 5 different types of poses - warrior2, goddess, downdog, - and plank, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 
I used transfer learning to leverage the InceptionV3 model, which is known to be top-of-the-line and the state-of-the-art when it comes to image processing. the model achieved an incredible accuracy of 95.53% ). 
the dataset is available on kaggle ("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niharika41298/yoga-poses-dataset")
